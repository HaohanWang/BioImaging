/**
 * @file ThinkGear.java
 * 
 * The ThinkGear Communications Driver (TGCD) is a set of library functions
 * which allows applications to communicate with ThinkGear modules.  The
 * TGCD functions are implemented as a shared library (.dll on Windows,
 * .bundle on Mac OS X).
 * <p>
 * This ThinkGear class for Java is simply a thin interface layer which uses 
 * Java Native Interface to provide access to the API functions in the TGCD
 * library, allowing Java programs to use the TGCD to communicate with
 * ThinkGear modules.
 * <p>
 * Because the class is merely a thin interface to the underlying shared
 * TGCD library, it is entirely dependent on the underlying TGCD library
 * to function, and is therefore only supported on platforms which can
 * run the TGCD itself (i.e. Windows and Mac OS X platforms).
 * <p>
 * There are three "tiers" of functions in this API, where functions
 * of a lower "tier" should not be called until an appropriate function
 * in the "tier" above it is called first:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * Tier 1:  Call anytime
 *     GetDriverVersion()
 *     GetNewConnectionId()
 *
 * Tier 2:  Requires GetNewConnectionId()
 *     SetStreamLog()
 *     SetDataLog()
 *     Connect()
 *     FreeConnection()
 *
 * Tier 3:  Requires Connect()
 *     ReadPackets()
 *     GetValue()
 *     SendByte()
 *     SetBaudrate()
 *     SetDataFormat()
 *     Disconnect()
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The contents of this file are generated from thinkgear.h, with the following
 * text manipulations:
 *   - "#define TG_"   => "public static final int "
 *   - "x ///<"        => "= x; ///<"
 *   - "THINKGEAR_API" => "public static native "
 *   - "const char *"  => "String "
 *   - "float"         => "double"
 *   - "TG_"           => ""
